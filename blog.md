# Third Year Project Blog
Written by Dzastina Laukaityte & Malavika Shanker

We are writing a blog to keep track of our progress throughout this project and also to be able to reflect on our achievements.

## Project Idea & Securing a Project Supervisor
Brainstorming an idea for our third-year project was not an easy task. It took us a bit of time to think through various options but we settled on a project idea. We decided to combine the world of modern learning with digital technology to create an educational application tailored for children known as “Trace ‘N Learn”. The application would specifically focus on facilitating the learning of the English alphabet through interactive and engaging activities. This mobile application would aim to provide a platform in which children can improve their skills in drawing each letter of the alphabet using the touch screen functionality of their devices. 

We decided to choose this project idea as we live in an age where technology is ever-evolving. The idea of creating a system which could help children learn their alphabets digitally would be very impactful and beneficial to them. We knew that choosing this project idea would provide us with a challenge and an interesting learning process from start to finish.

After doing a little bit of research we found a project supervisor that would suit our project perfectly which was Hyowon Lee. We went up to Hyowon after he had finished teaching his class and pitched him our idea. Hyowon was very on board with our project idea and even recommended us some additional ideas which we could implement later down the line in our project.

## Project Proposal
We had to write up a project proposal. This was a document that contained information about the plan of our project and what we hoped to achieve. After having a meeting with the project proposal board our project was approved and we were given the green light to start working on it. They said that our idea was very interesting and were very supportive of our project. All of this set us up for a running start to start working on our project. 

## Functional Specification
We had to write up a functional specification for our project. This document contained a general description of our project, functional requirements, system architecture, and high-level design. Additionally, it contained information about the timeline of the project and our learning challenges. This information was extremely important as it acted as the bones for our project. It really helped us to thoroughly think through our project steps and what we hoped to achieve throughout this project.

## Detecting Letter Strokes (Problem & Solution)
As we progressed with the functional aspect of our project we encountered a problem. This problem arose when attempting to test the functionality of detecting letter strokes. It was very difficult to calculate if a letter was drawn correctly and accurately according to the	letter guide or if it was drawn a bit outside of the letter guide. To solve this problem we ended up using the combination of stroke coordinate length and accuracy metrics where both had to be above a certain level for the letter drawn to be counted as correct. After this result was obtained we then normalized the the final accuracy score.

## Detecting Finishing Stroke (Problem & Solution) 
Another problem we encountered was how to determine whether a user was finished drawing their strokes. To solve this issue we decided to have a 3 second timeout after the user draws their last stroke. This helped the system to function better as it was able to more accurately determine the user's score considering that the system knew it was the last stroke drawn.

## User Interface
The User Interface (U.I.) proved to be quite challenging at times. We strived to use images that we were license-free and ended up using the website Freepik for our source of images. It was difficult to find a theme of images that were of similar design styles. We ended up settling on the theme of nature and animals as we wanted the application to create a positive and stress-free learning environment encouraging children to engage with the material at their own pace while simultaneously having fun.

Creating constraints using Android Studio for the images proved to be frustrating at times. When creating the constraints using Android Studio on either a Macbook or a Windows laptop once tested using an Android device the constraints would not align and in turn, it would misplace the U.I. of the application. We spent a lot of time working on the constraints to ensure that they aligned correctly when using an Android device as it greatly impacted the user’s experience.

## User Testing
We tested our application with 5 participants who were parents that met certain criteria. This critera was that the parent had a child/children in the age range of 3 to 11 years old who was learning their alphabets. The reason for choosing this criteria was for the parent to be able to provide us with their insight on the “Trace ‘N Learn” application and how their child might interact with it.  

Feedback from the parents about their experience testing the “Trace ‘N Learn” application was super positive. Additionally, the response of the parents when filling in our Google Form about their experience was again really positive. Some of the responses were that 4 out of the 5 parents said that they would give our application for their children to use. Another result revealed that 4 out of the 5 parents said that they think that a child would have fun using our application. We were extremely happy with the responses given by the parents.

## Final Words
Throughout working on this project we had fun and simultaneously gained so much knowledge from overcoming our challenges and learning curves. We strengthened our skills as a result of working on this project. Some of these skills included our ability to work in a team, our ability to work under pressure, and our ability to quickly learn and adapt to challenges that may occur. Additionally, we gained a lot of new hardware and software knowledge through using Android Studio and Firebase.

From our experience working on this project, we would in the future work again with the development of Android applications with the addition of more time as we found Android development to be extremely time-consuming. Android development contains a lot of moving parts and having additional time would greatly benefit the final product. Overall, we are very happy with the final product and the responses given by the parents who tested our application.
